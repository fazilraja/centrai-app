# CentrAI Brand Guidelines
## Applied AI Engineering for Startups & Small Businesses

---

## Brand Philosophy

### The Anti-Signal Principle

CentrAI embodies a deliberate aesthetic confidence—we don't need to look like technology because we ARE technology. This brand rejects the performative sleekness of conventional tech branding in favor of something more honest: the handcrafted quality of systems built by people who understand the fundamentals.

The aesthetic draws from the golden age of Bay Area computing (1960s-1970s) when innovation was happening in garages and research labs—raw, experimental, and profoundly optimistic about the future. This is retro-futurism not as nostalgia, but as a reminder that the most transformative technology has always had a human, almost artisanal quality to it.

**Brand Essence**: Confident simplicity. Technical depth. Human touch.

---

## Brand Voice

### Tone Attributes

**Confident, Never Arrogant**
We know our craft. We don't need to prove it with jargon or complexity. We speak plainly about complex things.

**Knowledgeable, Never Condescending**  
Technical depth presented accessibly. We teach, we don't lecture. We illuminate, we don't obscure.

**Warm, Never Casual**
Professional warmth. Approachable expertise. The feeling of working with someone who genuinely cares about your success.

**Pragmatic, Never Cynical**
Optimistic about technology's potential. Realistic about implementation. Honest about trade-offs.

### Writing Style

- Use active voice and clear, direct sentences
- Technical terms when necessary, plain language when possible
- Avoid marketing speak ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "synergy")
- Embrace the occasional em dash—they create rhythm
- Questions are powerful; rhetorical excess is not

**Example Messaging:**

❌ "Revolutionizing the AI landscape with cutting-edge solutions"  
✅ "We build AI systems that work—voice agents, RAG pipelines, automations that solve real problems"

❌ "Leverage our synergistic approach to unlock transformative value"  
✅ "Applied engineering means we focus on what actually works for your business"

## Color System

### Primary Palette: Cinematic Muted Tones

The color palette is inspired by color grading techniques from 1960s and 1970s technical documentation, faded photographs, and early computer schematics. These are not RGB-perfect colors—they're warm, slightly desaturated, with the organic quality of analog materials.

**Warm Neutrals (Foundation)**

- **Parchment** — `#F5F1E8` — Primary background, evokes aged paper
- **Stone** — `#E8E3D8` — Secondary background, card surfaces
- **Dust** — `#D4CFC4` — Dividers, subtle borders
- **Graphite** — `#4A4843` — Primary text, strong contrast
- **Charcoal** — `#2D2B28` — Headers, emphasis text

**Accent Colors (Nostalgia Palette)**

- **Faded Coral** — `#E89B8B` — Primary accent, human warmth (inspired by Anthropic's hand illustration)
- **Oxidized Copper** — `#C87D5E` — Secondary accent, technical heritage
- **Aged Brass** — `#D4A574` — Tertiary accent, geometric illustrations
- **Muted Sage** — `#B5BFA8` — Success states, completion
- **Dusty Blue** — `#8FA3B8` — Information, technical details
- **Faded Burgundy** — `#A65A5A` — Warnings, important notices

**Technical Palette (Code & Data)**

- **Terminal Green** — `#9CAF88` — Success, active states
- **Schematic Blue** — `#7B93A8` — Links, interactive elements
- **Warning Amber** — `#D4A664` — Cautionary states
- **Error Red** — `#B87A7A` — Error states (still muted)

### Color Usage Principles

**Background Hierarchy:**
- Primary surfaces: Parchment (#F5F1E8)
- Elevated surfaces: Stone (#E8E3D8)
- Borders and dividers: Dust (#D4CFC4)

**Text Hierarchy:**
- Headers: Charcoal (#2D2B28)
- Body text: Graphite (#4A4843)
- Secondary text: Graphite at 60-70% opacity

**Accent Usage:**
- Faded Coral for primary CTAs and key interactive elements
- Oxidized Copper for hover states and secondary interactions
- Aged Brass for geometric illustrations and technical diagrams
- Never use pure black (#000000) or pure white (#FFFFFF)

---

## Typography System

### Primary Typefaces

**Display & Headlines: Berkeley Mono or IBM Plex Mono**
Monospace typefaces connect to computing's typewriter heritage while maintaining excellent readability. Use for headlines, navigation, and any text that needs technical authority.

- **Headlines (H1):** 48-64px, 600 weight, tight tracking (-0.02em)
- **Subheadlines (H2):** 32-40px, 500 weight, normal tracking
- **Section Headers (H3):** 24-28px, 500 weight, slight tracking (0.01em)

**Body Text: Crimson Pro or Charter**
A serif with humanist qualities—readable, warm, slightly old-fashioned. This creates beautiful contrast with the monospace headers.

- **Body Large:** 18-20px, 400 weight, 1.6 line height
- **Body Regular:** 16-18px, 400 weight, 1.65 line height
- **Body Small:** 14-16px, 400 weight, 1.7 line height

**Alternative Sans-Serif: Inter or Untitled Sans**
For UI elements, captions, and technical specifications where serifs would be inappropriate.

- **UI Text:** 14-16px, 400-500 weight, 1.5 line height
- **Captions:** 12-14px, 400 weight, 1.4 line height
- **Labels:** 11-13px, 500 weight, uppercase, 0.05em tracking

### Typographic Principles

- Generous line height (1.6-1.7 for body text)
- Wide line length for primary content (65-75 characters optimal)
- Clear hierarchy through size, weight, and spacing—not color alone
- Monospace for anything technical: code, data, specifications
- Serif for narrative, explanation, human communication
- Sans-serif for UI chrome, navigation, metadata

## Logo & Identity Marks

### Primary Logo: The Crosshair/Target System

Based on your favicon, the logo system uses a **crosshair/targeting reticle** motif—a perfect synthesis of precision, focus, and retro computing aesthetics (early targeting systems, radar interfaces, precision instruments).

**Symbol Mark Components:**
- Circular outer ring (incomplete, hand-drawn quality)
- Four directional indicators (cardinal points)
- Central dot (the "center" of CentrAI)
- Slight imperfection in the circles—not perfectly computer-generated
- Can be rendered in single color or with subtle texture

**Wordmark: "CentrAI"**
- Set in Berkeley Mono or IBM Plex Mono
- Weight: 500-600
- "AI" can be slightly lighter weight or different color (Faded Coral) to create emphasis
- Letter spacing: slight tracking (0.02-0.03em)

### Logo Usage

**Full Logo:** Symbol + Wordmark (primary usage)
- Symbol to the left, wordmark to the right
- Vertical alternative: Symbol above, wordmark below

**Symbol Only:** For small applications, favicons, app icons
- The crosshair mark stands alone effectively
- Minimum size: 16px × 16px

**Wordmark Only:** For text-heavy contexts
- Navigation, footer, inline mentions
- "CentrAI" in brand monospace font

### Clear Space & Sizing

- Maintain clear space around logo equal to the height of the symbol
- Minimum size for full logo: 120px wide
- Minimum size for symbol: 32px × 32px

### Logo Color Variations

**Primary:** Charcoal (#2D2B28) on Parchment (#F5F1E8)
**Accent:** Faded Coral (#E89B8B) on Parchment (#F5F1E8)
**Reversed:** Parchment (#F5F1E8) on Charcoal (#2D2B28)
**Monochrome:** Graphite (#4A4843) or single-color versions for specific applications

## Visual Language

### Illustration Style: Technical Schematic Nostalgia

Inspired by 1960s/70s technical documentation, IBM design language, NASA mission graphics, and early computer science diagrams.

**Characteristics:**
- Line-based, geometric illustrations
- Slight hand-drawn imperfection (not perfectly computer-generated)
- Isometric or axonometric technical drawings
- Dot patterns, grid overlays, dimension lines
- Color from the accent palette (Aged Brass, Dusty Blue, Faded Coral)
- Reference: The Thinking Machines geometric diagram from your examples

**Subject Matter:**
- Neural network architectures (simplified, geometric)
- Data flow diagrams with retro computer aesthetic
- Isometric "machines" or systems
- Abstract representations of AI concepts
- Vintage computer components (punch cards, tape reels, circuit boards) reimagined

**Style Guidelines:**
- Line weight: 2-3px for primary lines, 1px for detail
- Corners: slight rounding (1-2px radius) for organic quality
- Colors: 2-3 colors maximum per illustration
- Backgrounds: always Parchment or Stone, never white
- Add subtle texture or grain overlay (5-10% opacity)

### Photography & Imagery

When photography is needed (team photos, case studies, environmental shots):

**Treatment:**
- Muted, desaturated color grading
- Warm color temperature (shift toward yellows/oranges)
- Reduced contrast (lifted blacks, lowered whites)
- Grain or film texture overlay
- Reference: Anthropic's hand illustration—organic, human, not clinical

**Subject Matter:**
- Hands working on keyboards (detail shots)
- Vintage computing equipment (aesthetic, not literal)
- Natural materials (wood, paper, analog tools)
- Bay Area landscapes (subtle nods to California tech heritage)
- Avoid: Stock photos of "futuristic" AI imagery, blue-toned tech photos, sterile office environments

### Iconography

**Style:** Simple, geometric, line-based icons
- 2px stroke weight
- Rounded corners (2px radius)
- 24×24px base grid
- Colors: Graphite or Charcoal
- Reference the crosshair motif subtly (circular or target-like elements)

**Applications:**
- Service offerings (RAG, voice agents, automations)
- Process steps (discover, design, deploy)
- Technical specifications (API, integrations, features)

## Grid System & Layout

### Spatial Principles: Generous Breathing Room

The layout system emphasizes **space** as much as content—inspired by Swiss design's clarity and Frank Lloyd Wright's sense of proportion.

**Grid Structure:**
- 12-column grid for desktop (1440px container, 1280px content)
- 8-column grid for tablet (768px)
- 4-column grid for mobile (375px)
- Gutter width: 24-32px (generous)
- Outer margins: 40-80px (very generous on desktop)

**Vertical Rhythm:**
- Base unit: 8px
- All spacing in multiples of 8px (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128)
- Section spacing: 96-128px between major sections
- Component spacing: 32-48px between related elements

### Layout Patterns

**Hero Sections:**
- Large, asymmetric compositions
- Headline on one side, illustration or large visual on the other
- Generous whitespace (minimum 80px margins)
- Reference: The Agency/42 minimal approach from your examples

**Content Sections:**
- Narrow text columns (max 680px width for readability)
- Side-by-side layouts with text and supporting visuals
- Cards with subtle borders (Dust color), generous padding
- Background color variations (Parchment vs Stone) to create subtle depth

**Call-to-Action Patterns:**
- Primary CTA: Solid background (Faded Coral), prominent but not aggressive
- Secondary CTA: Outlined button (Graphite), subtle hover state
- Text links: Underlined, Schematic Blue, subtle animation on hover

## Animation & Interaction

### Motion Principles

**Subtle and Purposeful:**
All animations should feel hand-crafted, not machine-generated. Think of the gentle movement of analog instruments, not digital snappiness.

**Timing:**
- Standard transitions: 200-300ms
- Complex animations: 400-600ms
- Easing: ease-in-out or custom bezier curves (no linear)

**Interaction Patterns:**

**Hover States:**
- Subtle color shifts (never dramatic)
- Slight scale changes (1.02-1.05x)
- Gentle shadows appearing or intensifying

**Page Transitions:**
- Soft fades (300ms)
- Subtle scale effects (starting at 0.98, ending at 1.0)

**Loading States:**
- Organic, non-mechanical loaders
- Circular progress with hand-drawn quality
- Pulsing effects rather than spinning

**Scroll Animations:**
- Parallax effects (very subtle, 0.2-0.5 speed difference)
- Fade-in on scroll (elements appear as user scrolls)
- Never jarring or disorienting

## Design System Governance

### When to Break the Rules

This brand system is designed to be confident and coherent, but not rigid. The anti-signal philosophy means sometimes the most authentic choice is to simplify even further, or to add a human touch that breaks perfect consistency.

**It's okay to:**
- Hand-draw an illustration rather than using perfect vectors
- Use a photo that's slightly "wrong" but emotionally right
- Simplify the color palette to just Parchment and Charcoal for maximum focus
- Let type be slightly imperfect if it serves the message

**Never compromise on:**
- Clarity and readability
- Accessible color contrast
- The core brand philosophy (anti-signal, technical confidence, human warmth)
- Avoiding generic tech aesthetic clichés

### Design Review Checklist

Before finalizing any brand application, ask:

1. **Does this feel handcrafted?** (Not generic, not template-driven)
2. **Is it technically confident?** (Shows expertise without showing off)
3. **Does it have warmth?** (Human, approachable, not cold or sterile)
4. **Is there enough space?** (Generous whitespace, breathing room)
5. **Would this work in 1972 and 2025?** (Timeless, not trendy)
6. **Does it avoid tech clichés?** (No gradients, no neon, no excessive blue)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Web Development Considerations

**Performance:**
- Optimize images with subtle grain/texture (use WebP format)
- Lazy-load illustrations and photos
- Use system fonts as fallbacks

**Accessibility:**
- Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for body text)
- Provide sufficient interactive target sizes (minimum 44×44px)
- Ensure focus states are clearly visible
- Test with screen readers

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach
- Reduce spacing proportionally on smaller screens
- Stack multi-column layouts on mobile
- Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Provide fallback fonts

### File Management

**Asset Organization:**

## Final Notes

**What Makes This Brand Work:**

The tension between old and new. The confidence to be simple. The technical depth that doesn't need to perform itself. This is a brand for people who understand technology deeply enough that they don't need to dress it up in chrome and gradients.

CentrAI's brand says: "We've been here before. We know how this works. We're not impressed by buzzwords. Let's build something that actually works."

That's the anti-signal. That's the confidence of craft.
