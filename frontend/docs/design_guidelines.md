# CentrAI Brand Guidelines
## Applied AI Engineering for Startups & Small Businesses

---

## Brand Philosophy

### The Anti-Signal Principle

CentrAI embodies a deliberate aesthetic confidence—we don't need to look like technology because we ARE technology. This brand rejects the performative sleekness of conventional tech branding in favor of something more honest: the precision and craft of systems built by people who understand the fundamentals.

**The Name Story: Center + AI**

The name itself tells the story. **Centr** (center) + **AI**. The logo—a bullseye, a targeting reticle—represents precision, focus, and hitting the mark. Like an archer who knows their craft, we don't waste shots. We aim true.

This is **Desert Tech** meets **New West modernism**. The aesthetic draws from Southwestern minimalism, precision instruments, survey markers, and the confident simplicity of craftspeople who know their tools. Think Marfa, Texas meeting Palo Alto—where wide open spaces meet focused innovation.

This is retro-futurism not as nostalgia, but as a reminder that the best technology has always been about precision, craft, and knowing exactly where you're aiming.

**Brand Essence**: Precision. Craft. Dead center.

## Brand Voice

### Tone Attributes

**Confident, Never Arrogant**
We know our craft. We don't need to prove it with jargon or complexity. We speak plainly about complex things.

**Knowledgeable, Never Condescending**  
Technical depth presented accessibly. We teach, we don't lecture. We illuminate, we don't obscure.

**Warm, Never Casual**
Professional warmth. Approachable expertise. The feeling of working with someone who genuinely cares about your success.

**Pragmatic, Never Cynical**
Optimistic about technology's potential. Realistic about implementation. Honest about trade-offs.

### Writing Style

- Use active voice and clear, direct sentences
- Technical terms when necessary, plain language when possible
- Avoid marketing speak ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "synergy")
- Embrace the occasional em dash—they create rhythm
- Questions are powerful; rhetorical excess is not

**Example Messaging:**

❌ "Revolutionizing the AI landscape with cutting-edge solutions"  
✅ "We build AI systems that work—voice agents, RAG pipelines, automations that solve real problems"

❌ "Leverage our synergistic approach to unlock transformative value"  
✅ "Applied engineering means we focus on what actually works for your business"

## Color System

### Primary Palette: Desert Tech

The color palette is inspired by Southwestern landscapes, precision instruments, and desert modernism. These colors feel grounded, warm, and distinctive—earthy tones that speak to craft and precision rather than digital excess. Think clay, sage, sand, and shadow.

**Foundation Neutrals**

- **Sand** — `#F7F3ED` — Primary background, warm off-white
- **Desert Beige** — `#E8DCC8` — Secondary background, card surfaces
- **Sage Gray** — `#ACA89A` — Dividers, subtle borders, muted elements
- **Deep Charcoal** — `#2D2B28` — Primary text, headers
- **Storm Gray** — `#4A4843` — Body text, secondary elements

**Accent Colors (Core Brand Palette)**

- **Rust** — `#C1644F` — Primary accent, CTAs, emphasis (terracotta/clay)
- **Deep Olive** — `#6B7456` — Secondary accent, natural/organic feeling
- **Dusty Clay** — `#9B6B5C` — Tertiary accent, warm depth
- **Wheat** — `#D4B996` — Highlight color, warm touches

**Technical Palette (UI & Interactive)**

- **Slate Blue** — `#5B6B7A` — Links, interactive elements
- **Deep Sage** — `#7A8470` — Success states, completion
- **Adobe Red** — `#A85446` — Warnings, errors (still muted)
- **Sandstone** — `#C9B99A` — Disabled states, low-emphasis elements

### Color Usage Principles

**Background Hierarchy:**
- Primary surfaces: Sand (#F7F3ED)
- Elevated surfaces: Desert Beige (#E8DCC8)
- Borders and dividers: Sage Gray (#ACA89A)

**Text Hierarchy:**
- Headers: Deep Charcoal (#2D2B28)
- Body text: Storm Gray (#4A4843)
- Secondary text: Storm Gray at 60% opacity or Sage Gray

**Accent Usage:**
- Rust for primary CTAs, active states, and key interactive elements
- Deep Olive for secondary interactions and organic/natural concepts
- Dusty Clay for hover states and warm depth
- Wheat for highlights and subtle emphasis
- Never use pure black (#000000) or pure white (#FFFFFF)

**The Three-Color Rule:**
For maximum impact and clarity, most layouts should use only 3 colors from the palette:
- **Classic:** Deep Charcoal + Rust + Sand
- **Natural:** Storm Gray + Deep Olive + Desert Beige
- **Warm:** Deep Charcoal + Dusty Clay + Wheat

### Color Accessibility

All primary color combinations meet WCAG AA standards:
- Rust (#C1644F) on Sand (#F7F3ED): 4.8:1 ✓
- Deep Charcoal (#2D2B28) on Sand (#F7F3ED): 13.5:1 ✓
- Slate Blue (#5B6B7A) on Sand (#F7F3ED): 5.2:1 ✓
- Storm Gray (#4A4843) on Sand (#F7F3ED): 8.9:1 ✓

## Typography System

### Primary Typefaces

**Display & Headlines: IBM Plex Mono or Berkeley Mono**
Monospace typefaces connect to precision, targeting, and technical craft. The fixed-width characters evoke survey markers, range finders, and the precise instruments of measurement. Use for headlines, navigation, and anything requiring technical authority.

- **Headlines (H1):** 48-64px, 600 weight, tight tracking (-0.02em)
- **Subheadlines (H2):** 32-40px, 500 weight, normal tracking
- **Section Headers (H3):** 24-28px, 500 weight, slight tracking (0.01em)

**Body Text: Inter or Untitled Sans**
A clean, modern sans-serif that provides excellent readability without the formality of serifs. This keeps the aesthetic grounded and contemporary while maintaining warmth through the color palette and spacing.

- **Body Large:** 18-20px, 400 weight, 1.6 line height
- **Body Regular:** 16-18px, 400 weight, 1.65 line height
- **Body Small:** 14-16px, 400 weight, 1.7 line height

**Alternative Option: Single Typeface System**
For maximum simplicity and impact, consider using **only IBM Plex Mono** or **Inter** at different weights:
- Headlines: 600-700 weight
- Subheads: 500-600 weight
- Body: 400 weight
- Captions: 400 weight, smaller size

**UI & Metadata: Inter**
For buttons, labels, captions, and form elements.

- **UI Text:** 14-16px, 400-500 weight, 1.5 line height
- **Captions:** 12-14px, 400 weight, 1.4 line height
- **Labels:** 11-13px, 500-600 weight, uppercase, 0.05em tracking

### Typographic Principles

- Generous line height (1.6-1.7 for body text)
- Wide line length for primary content (65-75 characters optimal)
- Clear hierarchy through size, weight, and spacing—not color alone
- Monospace for headlines and anything requiring precision or technical authority
- Sans-serif for body text maintains accessibility and contemporary feel
- Never use more than 2 typefaces (ideally just 1 typeface family)

---

## Logo & Identity Marks

### Primary Logo: The Bullseye / Targeting System

The logo is a **bullseye**—a targeting reticle that represents precision, focus, and hitting dead center. This is the visual embodiment of "centr" (center) in CentrAI.

**Symbol Mark Philosophy:**
The bullseye isn't just a logo—it's a promise. Like an archer who has trained for years, we don't waste shots. We aim true. We hit center.

**Symbol Mark Components:**
- Circular targeting rings (slightly hand-drawn quality, not perfectly mechanical)
- Four cardinal directional indicators (crosshairs)
- Central dot (the "center" of CentrAI—the bullseye)
- Slight imperfection in the circles—crafted, not computer-generated
- Can be rendered in single color or with subtle depth

**Visual References:**
- Rifle scopes and precision optics
- Survey markers and range finders
- Archery targets
- Navigation instruments
- Early radar and targeting systems

**Wordmark: "centrAI"**
- Set in IBM Plex Mono or Berkeley Mono
- Weight: 500-600
- Lowercase "centr" + uppercase "AI" option, or all lowercase "centrai"
- "AI" can be in Rust color to create emphasis, or keep monochrome
- Letter spacing: slight tracking (0.02-0.03em)

### Logo Usage

**Full Logo:** Symbol + Wordmark (primary usage)
- Symbol to the left, wordmark to the right
- Vertical alternative: Symbol above, wordmark below
- Ample spacing between symbol and wordmark

**Symbol Only:** For small applications, favicons, app icons
- The bullseye mark stands alone powerfully
- Minimum size: 16px × 16px
- Works at any size due to simple geometry

**Wordmark Only:** For text-heavy contexts
- Navigation, footer, inline mentions
- "centrAI" or "CentrAI" in brand monospace font

### Clear Space & Sizing

- Maintain clear space around logo equal to the height of the symbol
- Minimum size for full logo: 120px wide
- Minimum size for symbol: 24px × 24px (retains clarity even smaller)

### Logo Color Variations

**Primary:** Deep Charcoal (#2D2B28) on Sand (#F7F3ED)
**Accent:** Rust (#C1644F) on Sand (#F7F3ED)
**Reversed:** Sand (#F7F3ED) on Deep Charcoal (#2D2B28)
**Monochrome:** Storm Gray (#4A4843) for subtle applications
**All Rust:** Rust (#C1644F) monochrome for bold moments

## Visual Language

### Illustration Style: Precision Instruments & Desert Modernism

The illustration style draws from precision instruments, survey markers, targeting systems, and Southwestern geometric patterns. Think technical drawings with a human touch—crafted, not generated.

**Characteristics:**
- Line-based, geometric illustrations with purpose
- Slight hand-drawn imperfection (organic, not mechanical)
- Isometric or axonometric technical drawings
- Circular motifs (referencing the bullseye)
- Topographic lines, range markers, measurement indicators
- Color from the accent palette (Rust, Deep Olive, Wheat, Dusty Clay)
- Maximum 2-3 colors per illustration

**Conceptual Themes:**
- **Targeting & Precision:** Crosshairs, range finders, scope reticles, bullseyes
- **Survey & Measurement:** Topographic maps, survey markers, grid systems
- **Desert Geometry:** Adobe architecture, Southwestern patterns (simplified)
- **Technical Instruments:** Compasses, protractors, measuring tools
- **Network & Systems:** Neural networks reimagined as survey maps or targeting overlays

**Style Guidelines:**
- Line weight: 2-3px for primary lines, 1px for detail
- Corners: slight rounding (1-2px radius) for organic quality
- Colors: Use Rust + Deep Olive, or Dusty Clay + Wheat combinations
- Backgrounds: always Sand or Desert Beige, never pure white
- Add subtle texture or grain overlay (3-5% opacity)
- Icons should feel like precision instruments, not playful emojis

**What to Avoid:**
- Generic tech illustrations (circuit boards, binary code, robot faces)
- Bright, saturated colors
- 3D renderings or realistic imagery
- Curved, bubbly, or overly playful shapes
- Gradient fills

### Photography & Imagery

When photography is needed, it should reinforce the Desert Tech aesthetic:

**Treatment:**
- Warm, slightly desaturated color grading
- Increased warmth (shift toward earth tones)
- Reduced contrast (lifted blacks, subtle highlights)
- Fine grain or texture overlay (film-like quality)
- Never overly sharp or clinical

**Subject Matter:**
- Hands working with tools or technology (detail shots showing craft)
- Desert landscapes (wide open spaces, minimalist compositions)
- Natural materials (wood, leather, metal, stone)
- Precision instruments and tools
- Southwestern architecture and geometry
- **Avoid:** Generic stock photos, people in suits, sterile offices, neon lights

### Iconography

**Style:** Simple, geometric, precision-focused icons
- 2px stroke weight (consistent with illustration style)
- Rounded corners (2px radius) for warmth
- 24×24px base grid
- Colors: Deep Charcoal, Storm Gray, or Rust for emphasis
- Reference the bullseye/circular motif subtly in design
- Icons should feel like tools or instruments, not decorations

**Icon Themes:**
- Service offerings: Use targeting/precision metaphors (RAG = targeting data, Voice = sound waves in crosshairs)
- Process steps: Survey markers, waypoints, checkpoints
- Features: Instrument-inspired (gauge, compass, scope)

## Grid System & Layout

### Spatial Principles: Generous Breathing Room

The layout system emphasizes **space** as much as content—inspired by Swiss design's clarity and Frank Lloyd Wright's sense of proportion.

**Grid Structure:**
- 12-column grid for desktop (1440px container, 1280px content)
- 8-column grid for tablet (768px)
- 4-column grid for mobile (375px)
- Gutter width: 24-32px (generous)
- Outer margins: 40-80px (very generous on desktop)

**Vertical Rhythm:**
- Base unit: 8px
- All spacing in multiples of 8px (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128)
- Section spacing: 96-128px between major sections
- Component spacing: 32-48px between related elements

### Layout Patterns

**Hero Sections:**
- Large, asymmetric compositions
- Headline on one side, illustration or large visual on the other
- Generous whitespace (minimum 80px margins)
- Reference: The Agency/42 minimal approach from your examples

**Content Sections:**
- Narrow text columns (max 680px width for readability)
- Side-by-side layouts with text and supporting visuals
- Cards with subtle borders (Dust color), generous padding
- Background color variations (Parchment vs Stone) to create subtle depth

**Call-to-Action Patterns:**
- Primary CTA: Solid background (Faded Coral), prominent but not aggressive
- Secondary CTA: Outlined button (Graphite), subtle hover state
- Text links: Underlined, Schematic Blue, subtle animation on hover

## Animation & Interaction

### Motion Principles

**Subtle and Purposeful:**
All animations should feel hand-crafted, not machine-generated. Think of the gentle movement of analog instruments, not digital snappiness.

**Timing:**
- Standard transitions: 200-300ms
- Complex animations: 400-600ms
- Easing: ease-in-out or custom bezier curves (no linear)

**Interaction Patterns:**

**Hover States:**
- Subtle color shifts (never dramatic)
- Slight scale changes (1.02-1.05x)
- Gentle shadows appearing or intensifying

**Page Transitions:**
- Soft fades (300ms)
- Subtle scale effects (starting at 0.98, ending at 1.0)

**Loading States:**
- Organic, non-mechanical loaders
- Circular progress with hand-drawn quality
- Pulsing effects rather than spinning

**Scroll Animations:**
- Parallax effects (very subtle, 0.2-0.5 speed difference)
- Fade-in on scroll (elements appear as user scrolls)
- Never jarring or disorienting

## Design System Governance

### When to Break the Rules

This brand system is designed to be confident and coherent, but not rigid. The anti-signal philosophy means sometimes the most authentic choice is to simplify even further, or to add a human touch that breaks perfect consistency.

**It's okay to:**
- Hand-draw an illustration rather than using perfect vectors
- Use a photo that's slightly "wrong" but emotionally right
- Simplify the color palette to just Parchment and Charcoal for maximum focus
- Let type be slightly imperfect if it serves the message

**Never compromise on:**
- Clarity and readability
- Accessible color contrast
- The core brand philosophy (anti-signal, technical confidence, human warmth)
- Avoiding generic tech aesthetic clichés

### Design Review Checklist

Before finalizing any brand application, ask:

1. **Does this feel handcrafted?** (Not generic, not template-driven)
2. **Is it technically confident?** (Shows expertise without showing off)
3. **Does it have warmth?** (Human, approachable, not cold or sterile)
4. **Is there enough space?** (Generous whitespace, breathing room)
5. **Would this work in 1972 and 2025?** (Timeless, not trendy)
6. **Does it avoid tech clichés?** (No gradients, no neon, no excessive blue)

---

- Provide sufficient interactive target sizes (minimum 44×44px)
- Ensure focus states are clearly visible
- Test with screen readers

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach
- Reduce spacing proportionally on smaller screens
- Stack multi-column layouts on mobile
- Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Final Notes

**What Makes This Brand Work:**

**The Bullseye Promise.** Every element reinforces precision, focus, and hitting the mark. The colors are grounded and earthy—we're not floating in digital space, we're building on solid ground. The typography is clear and direct—monospace for precision, sans-serif for accessibility.

**Desert Tech Aesthetic.** This isn't California cool or New York slick. It's Southwestern confidence—wide open spaces, clear sight lines, and the quiet assurance of someone who knows their craft. The warm, muted palette feels human and approachable while maintaining technical authority.

**Simplicity as Strength.** The three-color rule (Charcoal + Rust + Sand) means every design can be bold and clear. No gradients, no effects, no tricks—just precise, purposeful design.

CentrAI's brand says: "We know where we're aiming. We don't miss. Let's build something that works."

That's the promise of the bullseye. That's the confidence of craft.
